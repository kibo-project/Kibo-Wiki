## Timeouts and Business Rules

        T3 --> T4[04:00 Aliado takes]
        T4 --> T5[07:00 Aliado pays bank]

    style T7 fill:#c8e6c9
```

### üîí **Locking Rules**

| Rule | Description | Implementation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **One aliado, one order** | Aliado can only have 1 TAKEN order at a time | `WHERE ally_id IS NULL AND user NOT IN (SELECT ally_id FROM orders WHERE status='TAKEN')` |
| **Timeout penalty** | Aliado who lets order expire gets blocked 30 min | `INSERT INTO ally_penalties (penalty_until = NOW() + INTERVAL '30 minutes')` |
| **No retaking expired order** | Same aliado cannot retake order they let expire | `WHERE order_id NOT IN (SELECT order_id FROM ally_penalties WHERE ally_id = ?)` |
| **Country specific** | Aliados only see orders from their country | `WHERE user.country = ally.country` |
| **Unique quote** | One quote per order, fixed until completion | `UPDATE quotes SET is_active=false WHERE order_id = ?` |

### üö® **Automatic Error Handling**

```mermaid

    ERROR{Error Detected} --> |Blockchain payment fails| REFUND_USER[Immediate Refund]
    ERROR --> |Aliado doesn't respond| PENALTY[Penalize + Refund]

    ERROR --> |Image too large| REJECT[Reject upload]

    style ERROR fill:#ffcdd2
    style REFUND_USER fill:#c8e6c9
    style PENALTY fill:#ffecb3
    style LOG fill:#e1f5fe
```

### üìä **Performance Metrics**

| Metric | MVP Target | Measurement |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Average order time** | < 10 minutes | `AVG(completed_at - created_at)` |
| **Success rate** | > 80% | `COMPLETED / TOTAL * 100` |
| **Timeout rate** | < 15% | `EXPIRED / TOTAL * 100` |
| **Daily active aliados** | > 5 aliados | `COUNT(DISTINCT ally_id) WHERE DATE(taken_at) = TODAY` |
| **Daily volume** | > 1000 BOB | `SUM(amount_fiat) WHERE DATE(created_at) = TODAY` |
